ython Fundamentals

Exercise 1  
Write Python code that prints your name, student number and email address.  
An example runs of the program:  
Bob 
ST1001 
bob@gmail.com 

Exercise 2 
Write Python code that prints your name, student number and email address using escape sequences.     
An example runs of the program: 
Bob 
ST1001 
bob@gmail.com 

Exercise 3 
Write Python code that add, subtract, multiply and divide the two numbers. You can use the two numbers 14 and 7.  An example run of the program:  
14 + 7 = 21 
14 * 7 = 98 
14 – 7 = 7 
14 / 7 = 2 

Exercise 4
Write Python code that displays the numbers from 1 to 5 as steps. 
An example runs of the program: 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 

Exercise 5
Write Python code that outputs the following sentence (including the quotation marks and line break) to the screen: 
An example runs of the program:  
"SDK" stands for "Software Development Kit", whereas 
"IDE" stands for "Integrated Development Environment". 

Exercise 6
Practice and check the output
print("python is an \"awesome\" language.")
print("python\n\t2023")
print('I\'m from Entri.\b')
print("\65")
print("\x65")
print("Entri", "2023", sep="\n")
print("Entri", "2023", sep="\b")
print("Entri", "2023", sep="*", end="\b\b\b\b")

Exercise 7
Define the variables below. Print the types of each variable. What is the sum of your variables? (Hint: use a type conversion function.) What datatype is the sum?
num=23
textnum="57"
decimal=98.3

Exercise 8
calculate the number of minutes in a year using variables for each unit of time. print a statement that describes what your code does also. Create three variables to store no of days in a year, minute in a hour, hours in a day, then calculate the total minutes in a year and print the values
(hint) total number of minutes in an year =No.of days in an year * Hours in a day * Minutes in an hour

Exercise 9
Write Python code that asks the user to enter his/her name and then output/prints his/her name with a greeting.
An example runs of the program:
Please enter you name: Tony
Hi Tony, welcome to Python programming :)

Exercise 10
Name your file: PoundsToDollars.py
